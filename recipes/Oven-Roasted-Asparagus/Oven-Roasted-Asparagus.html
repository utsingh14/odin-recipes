    <p>This roasted asparagus recipe is incredibly popular among Allrecipes community members — and for good reason!
        It’s easy, customizable, and absolutely delicious. </p>

    <h1>How to Cook Asparagus</h1>
    <p>You'll find a detailed ingredient list and step-by-step instructions in the recipe below, but let's go over the
        basics:</p>

    <h2>How to Trim Asparagus</h2>
    <p>The quickest and easiest way to trim your asparagus is to line up all the (clean) stalks on a cutting board, then
        use a sharp chef’s knife to cut off the thick ends. That’s all there is to it! If you’re worried about cutting
        at the wrong place, here’s a tip from recipe creator swedishmilk: “To remove woody ends, grab a stalk of
        asparagus at either end and bend until it snaps. It will naturally snap where it starts to get tough.”</p>

    <h2>How to Season Asparagus</h2>
    <p>This asparagus is simply seasoned with fresh garlic, sea salt, and black pepper. Parmesan cheese and fresh lemon
        juice also lend tons of flavor. This is a versatile recipe, so feel free to add spices and customize the
        seasonings to suit your taste.</p>

    <h2>How to Cook Asparagus In the Oven</h2>
    <p>Roasting asparagus couldn’t be easier: Toss the asparagus with olive oil and sprinkle it with cheese and
        seasonings. Arrange the stalks in a single layer in a baking dish, then bake until tender. Sprinkle the roasted
        asparagus with lemon juice before serving, if you like. </p>

    <h2>How Long to Bake Asparagus</h2>
    <p>In an oven preheated to 425 degrees F, the asparagus should be perfectly roasted after about 12 to 15 minutes.
    </p>

    <h1>Test Kitchen Tips</h1>
    <p>“This is probably the way I cook asparagus most often,” says culinary producer and test kitchen expert Nicole
        McLaughlin. “It’s so easy, comes together in one pan, and has so much flavor.” Here are a few of Nicole’s top
        tips for roasting asparagus perfectly every time: </p>

    Though Nicole opts for meatier asparagus stalks for grilling, she prefers thinner stalks for roasting — the skinnier
    ones tend to crisp up better.
    Choose asparagus that is firm, but has a bit of give. Also, make sure to cut off the woody ends.
    “You don’t want these overlapping or crowding the pan,” Nicole says of the oiled and seasoned asparagus stalks.
    “Because then they’ll end up steaming and you won’t get all that color.”
    <h1>What to Serve With Roasted Asparagus </h1>
    <p>Recipe creator swedishmilk suggests serving this roasted asparagus recipe with lamb or grilled fish – but it
        would also pair well with chicken, steak, or pork. If you’re looking for an entrée to serve with this delicious
        side dish: </p>
    <ul>

        <li>Grilled Sea Bass</li>
        <li>Roasted Rack of Lamb</li>
        <li>Perfect Chicken </li>
        <li>Sirloin Steak With Garlic Butter</li>
        <li>Simple Savory Pork Roast</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>How to Store Roasted Asparagus</h1>
    <p>This roasted asparagus will taste best the day it’s cooked. However, if you have leftovers, you can store them in
        an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to three days. </p>

    <h1>Allrecipes Community Tips and Praise</h1>
    <p> “I used lemon-infused oil and it was delicious,” raves Kim. “Even my friends who aren't fond of asparagus were
        impressed.”</p>

    <p> “Came out delicious and so easy,” according to cathcartflo. “I made a Hollandaise sauce to go with it and loved
        it.”</p>

    <p>“Really easy to do,” says one Allrecipes community member. “I paired this with baked salmon and was able to cook
        both in the oven, together, at the specified temperature and time in this recipe and both tasted great!”</p>
